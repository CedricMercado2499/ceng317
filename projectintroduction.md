# Project Introduction
Our focus has been on six areas of ongoing/continuing multi-year work. In these areas, we welcomed brief project charters from industry that proposed the scope, mandate, and contain the system specification (design approach and requirements).

1. Facilities: Bicycle Rental/Parking Lot/Vision System
2. Building Automation: Greenhouse/SolarPanel/Home
3. Consumer: Entertainment Protocol DMX/Baby Monitoring Project
4. Education: Robust Hackable Educational Project
5. Robotics: Control/Navigation/Dashboard
6. Health and Wellness: Wearable 

Currently getting up to speed with the state of the art has been a challenge let alone making a contribution. For example, a modern parking lot will contain vehicle sensors, license plate recognition, RFID/transponders, etc.

Regarding a more accessible project example, there was a time that one would go to a bicycle rental company's shack, provide something of value as a deposit and the person working at the shack would provide a bicycle on the understanding that you would return it along with payment for the amount of time that you used it in exchange for return of your deposit.

Times have changed, now you use your smart phone to provide your credit card information to the bicycle rental company and then you are provided the code to unlock a bicycle and you are charged based on when you next lock it up.

The Computer Engineering Technology capstone consists of creating project similar to this. In this example there is a lock mechanism, a set of buttons to enter a code, lights and sound to provide feedback. In CENG 317, students learn how to build the spokes. In CENG 319, students learn how to write the corresponding app. In CENG 355, the group would package everything up together as a functioning prototype.
